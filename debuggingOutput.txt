TACTICS
During Combat If spotted by the PCs, Norys attacks
immediately. If the PCs move inside the bridge and do
not detect Norys, she can attack from behind, activating
her haste circuit. She uses her breath weapon whenever
possible and uses hit and run trick attacks in conjunction
with her cloaking field, focusing on the weakest-looking PCs
first. She hides and uses a healing serum when reduced to
60 hp or less.
Morale Norys switches to using multiattacks when she runs
out of healing serum and is reduced to 60 hp or less, fighting
to the death.

SPECIAL ABILITIES
Dragon Operative (Ex) Norys has learned to use her innate
draconic attacks with precision and dexterity. She can use
her trick attack with her natural weapons. She does not add
her trick attack damage to her attacks, but her target is still
flat-footed and she can use her debilitating tricks.
Icewalking (Ex) A white dragon can move across icy surfaces
without penalty and doesnâ€™t need to attempt Acrobatics
checks to run or charge on ice. In addition, a white dragon
can climb icy surfaces as if under the effect of spider climb.
