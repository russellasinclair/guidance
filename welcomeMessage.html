<p>Welcome to Guidance! This tool assists Pathfinder 2e GMs in Roll20. It has the ability to read a statblock from the
    GMNotes section of a selected character and fill out the NPC section of the charactersheet. Statblocks from Archives
    of Nethys and PDFs are supported.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><h2>THE MAIN COMMANDS</h2> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>
    <em><strong>!pf_npc</strong></em></p> <p>This imports a statblock from the GM Notes section of a character sheet and
    will out the NPC section of the Pathfinder character sheet. Furthermore, it configures the token's hit points and
    give AC indicators.</p> <p><em>How to:</em></p>
<ol>
    <li>Select and copy a stat block and paste it into the "GM Notes" section of a Character sheet. (Don't worry about
        removing any formatting)
    </li>
    <li>Click Save.</li>
    <li>Select the token that you have<a href="https://wiki.roll20.net/Linking_Tokens_to_Journals"> linked to the
        character sheet</a>.
    </li>
    <li>Type !pf_npc. The script attempts to use the statblock to fill out the NPC section of the Starfinder (Simple)
        character sheet.
    </li>
</ol> <p>The script supports character statblocks from the <a href="https://2e.aonprd.com/">Archives of Nethys</a> and
    <span style="font-style: italic;">Society PDFs. Double check the results after importing a statblock. From time to time, abilities of various types MAY include text from another ability. IF THIS HAPPENS, you can add the @ at the end of an ability that has text from the next ability included.</span>
</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><p><em><strong>!pf_clean</strong></em></p> <p>I've included this for completeness, but be warned -
    this command will <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>PERMANENTLY ERASE</strong></span> things from
    the character sheet so use with caution. As above, this command requires selecting a token that has been <a
            href="https://wiki.roll20.net/Linking_Tokens_to_Journals">linked to the character sheet</a>.</p> <p><em>How
    to:</em></p> <p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em><strong>!pf_clean CONFIRM</strong></em> - This will erase ALL stats
    from the character sheet AND remove ALL formatting from the token. It will not touch the GM Notes section of the
    character sheet so it can be reimported using !pf_npc.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong><em>!pf_clean
    ABILITIES</em></strong> - This will rease ALL macros from the character sheet.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><h3>OTHER USEFUL
    FEATURES</h3> <p><em><strong>!pf_addspell</strong></em></p> <p>This adds a spell to the NPC character sheet as a
    macro. Similar to pf_ability, when you run the macro to call this, a box appears allowing you to paste the full text
    of the spell. The script formats the spellblock. Afterwards, I recommend manually editing the macro in the
    "description" tag to tailor the results of the macro for use in play.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Find other details on the
